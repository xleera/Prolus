## How to contribute with code/ideas

##### I want to help develop the bot and i know how to do it!
Awesome! just follow these steps
Quick steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Improve some stuff.
3. Create a pull request to the **Dev** branch.
4. Be patient, a approved developer will review your code and accept it as soon as he/she is available.


Your pull request can be denied for the following reasons:

- Annoying developers by asking them to approve their pull request.
- Not adding/improving functionality.
- Code that breaks the bot.
- Contain nsfw, or any other unacceptable content(s).
- Code that breaks [Discord Tos](https://discordapp.com/tos) or sends to many api requests to cause ratelimits.
- Any other reason.

##### I have a great idea!
Awesome, just go to [this page](https://trello.com/b/T6z6P6Zh) and check if your idea is on there. If not, go to [this page](https://trello.com/c/ZjZw3dMu/) and comment your suggestion!

# How to contribute with images

##### I have designed an image that is perfect for Prolus!
Awesome! Please go to [this page](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzSHE5TaXGg6Fd5HyrNcw6lNzi-ZdrXxV1r7kU-4WrIPX8MA/viewform) to upload your image, you can see guidelines for posting images on there.

##### This person has some awesome images, is it ok if i just copy his images and upload them for Prolus?
No, that's not ok.
If we don't have their approval we can't use them. You can consider asking them if they want to upload their images to Prolus.
Just remember: Stealing other peoples work is not cool.
